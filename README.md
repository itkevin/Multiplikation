6. Check your stats anytime by clicking "Auswertung" (Evaluation).

## 🤖 The AI Showdown: Claude 3.5 vs. Codestral

This project was born out of curiosity: How would different AI coding assistants approach building a simple math game? I put Claude 3.5 and Codestral to the test, and the result is this fully functional multiplication practice game!

## 🚀 Features

- Personalized practice sessions
- Adaptive difficulty based on player performance
- Detailed statistics with a cool heat map visualization

## 👨‍💻 The Code

All the code in this project - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - was generated by AI. It's a testament to how far AI-assisted coding has come and a fun exploration of what's possible when humans and AI collaborate on software projects.

## 🎉 Have Fun!

Whether you're here to brush up on your multiplication tables or to explore AI-generated code, I hope you enjoy this little project. Happy calculating!
